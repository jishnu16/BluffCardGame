	<p>
		<h3>What is Bluff game?</h3>
		The aim of the game is to get rid of all your cards by playing them. Since cards are played face down, giving players the option to lie about the cards they are playing, but if the lie is exposed the player must pick up all the played cards. If any player think that someone lies he or she can challenge the player.
		<br/>
		All players are required to play the same rank until a new round start.
	</p>
	<p>
		<h3>Number Of Players</h3>
		It's a three player game.After joining the game, you have to wait for other players to join the game. When three players are join game will start.
	</p>
	<p>
		<h3>How to play the game</h3>
		Who join first, designated as the lid, begins a round by saying a rank (such as "queen", 9 ,"ace" etc.) of a card and playing as many card he wish to play. The card /cards played may or may not actually match the announced rank, but no one knows for sure except the person who played it.
		<br/>
		Turn going on according to joining the game. Each player then takes a turn consisting of one of two options: 
		<br/>
		<b>1.Pass without playing a card. </b>
		<br/>
		<b>Play a single card or cards.</b> The played card is claimed to match the rank announced by the lead, but in fact the card may or may not match this rank. <b>Note that the rank announced by the lead must be followed until the round is over</b>. 
		<br/>
		The play continues around the table as many times as necessary until everyone passes or there is a challenge. Note that if all the other players pass, it is perfectly legal (and very common) for one player to repeatedly add cards to the stack.
	</p>
	<p>
		<h3>Ending a round</h3>
		The round can end in two ways.
		<br/>
		<b>1. All players pass </b>
		<br/>
		If all players consecutive pass, the cards in the stack are removed from play, without being revealed. A new round Will strat.
		<br/>
		<b>2. Challenge</b> 
		<br/>
		After any play, and before another card(s) is played , the player of the last card may be challenged by any other player - you do not have to wait for your turn to challenge. The challenging player is the first who declares "Bluff". If it is something other than the rank announced by the lead, then the person who played it must pick up all payed cards begining from that round. If the played card matches the rank announced by the lead, then the challenger must pick up the all payed cards begining from that round.
	</p>
	<p>
		<h3>Ending the Game</h3>
		As soon as a player get rid of all cards the game will end. Other playes rank will decide based on the number of cards they have.
